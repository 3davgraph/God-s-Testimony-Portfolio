By the Grace of God, He helped me use AI to make an automated install of guacamole. Through troubleshooting, this is the results. I fully working docker install in alpine.
## NOTE:
### the "after-install" file MUST be run after installing the containers. It can be ajusted to your distro. vi or nano setup-guac.sh and paste it in their. 
### chmod +x setup-guac.sh &&  ./setup-guac.sh to run
