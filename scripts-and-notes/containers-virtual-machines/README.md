This script was put together with some help from AI because I got tired of making new users inside containers on Proxmox, only to find things like the history command, up arrow, and tab completion weren’t working right away.

This script makes it so when you create a new user, their home folder and basic settings are ready to go from the start.

It’s a way to work smarter and be a good steward of the time and tools God has given us.
