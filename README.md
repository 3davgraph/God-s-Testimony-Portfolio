In these folders are scripts and notes that God has allowed me to either create myself (sometimes with the help of AI) or find from others to help automate simple tasks. These include:

1.  Adding a new user and making the terminal fully usable inside a Proxmox container

2.  Instructions for setting up and sharing files using Samba on Linux

3.  An ffmpeg command for extracting audio from a video file

4.  Many more includedâ€”and more to come, Lord willing

[[Future Ideas]]
I plan to add how God helped and led me in building my home lab and setting up the services I use.
